## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Binance Futures API Configuration
VITE_BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key_here
VITE_BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret_here

# Environment Configuration (set to true for testnet)
VITE_BINANCE_TESTNET=false
```

### 2. API Key Setup

1. Create a Binance account at [binance.com](https://binance.com)
2. Go to API Management in your account settings
3. Create a new API key with futures trading permissions
4. **Important**: Enable "Enable Futures" permission
5. Add your API key and secret to the `.env` file

**For Testnet (Recommended for Development):**
1. Visit [testnet.binancefuture.com](https://testnet.binancefuture.com)
2. Create a testnet account
3. Generate testnet API keys
4. Set `VITE_BINANCE_TESTNET=true` in your `.env` file

### 3. Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 4. Security Considerations

- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Use testnet for development and testing
- Implement proper IP restrictions on your API keys
- Use read-only permissions for market data features
- Only enable trading permissions when necessary
