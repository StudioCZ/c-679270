## üîß Setup Instructions (REQUIRED)

### Step 1: Get Binance API Credentials

**For Development/Testing (Recommended):**
1. Visit [Binance Futures Testnet](https://testnet.binancefuture.com/)
2. Create a testnet account (free, no real money required)
3. Generate API keys in the testnet dashboard
4. Copy your testnet API Key and Secret Key

**For Production Trading:**
1. Create a Binance account at [binance.com](https://binance.com)
2. Complete account verification
3. Go to [API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)
4. Create a new API key with the following settings:
   - ‚úÖ **Enable Futures** (REQUIRED)
   - ‚úÖ Enable Reading (for market data)
   - ‚úÖ Enable Spot & Margin Trading (if needed)
   - ‚ùå Disable Withdrawals (for security)
5. Set IP restrictions for additional security (optional but recommended)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env` file in the project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API credentials:

```env
# For Testnet (Recommended for development)
VITE_BINANCE_API_KEY=your_testnet_api_key_here
VITE_BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_testnet_secret_key_here
VITE_BINANCE_TESTNET=true

# For Production (Real trading)
# VITE_BINANCE_API_KEY=your_production_api_key_here
# VITE_BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_production_secret_key_here
# VITE_BINANCE_TESTNET=false
```

### Step 3: Install and Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 403 Forbidden Error
If you see "403 Forbidden" errors:

1. **Check API Key Validity**: Ensure your API key and secret are correct
2. **Enable Futures Permission**: Your API key MUST have "Enable Futures" permission
3. **Check IP Restrictions**: If you set IP restrictions, ensure your current IP is whitelisted
4. **Verify Account Status**: Ensure your Binance account is in good standing
5. **Use Testnet**: Switch to testnet for development: `VITE_BINANCE_TESTNET=true`

### WebSocket Connection Errors
If WebSocket connections fail:

1. **Check Network**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
2. **Firewall Settings**: Check if your firewall is blocking WebSocket connections
3. **API Credentials**: WebSocket issues often relate to the same problems as REST API errors
4. **Try Testnet**: Switch to testnet to isolate the issue

### Environment Variable Issues
If environment variables aren't loading:

1. **File Location**: Ensure `.env` file is in the project root directory
2. **File Name**: Must be exactly `.env` (not `.env.local` or `.env.example`)
3. **Restart Server**: Restart the development server after changing `.env`
4. **No Quotes**: Don't wrap values in quotes in the `.env` file
